# CRDT Demo - Message Board - Automerge Repo

[Automerge Repo](https://github.com/automerge/automerge-repo) is
a library which provides fast implementations of several different CRDTs
(which allow merging client data without server coordination), as well as pluggable networking and storage.

The idea of this project is to show a simple minimal example of what Automerge can do.

## How to run it locally?

Just have node installed on your local environment, then run:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
